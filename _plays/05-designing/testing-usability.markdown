<h4> User testing from the beginnnig </h4>
Before any project begins we research our users, what devices they use, any constraints we have to over-come. Only when we fully understand who the user is can we then form our ideas. Going into a project with presumptions on users can be the biggest burden on any project. Once a team has made presumptions is hard to move away from them. 

Our user testing starts as soon as our sketches hit the paper. We are constantly testing usability, starting internally, as we develop our ideas within the team. 
Finding users can often be a struggle, especially a specific user group. We are fortunate enough to work with clients who can aquire their own user sample for us to utilise but when this isn't an option we love sites like UsabilityHub. UsablityHub allows you to create simple tests from design preference to navigation and user journey testing. 

As part of our tool kit we also use invision to create testable prototypes. Invision allows us to share screens directly with the devices they are designed for, making it easy to create testing in situ. 

Our main form of testing is obvservation. We like to recreate how the user would use the interface in their own environment as much as possible, this allows us to perform non intrusive observations. Heat mapping or screen recording also us to follow the users movement around a page, where they tried to click or hovered without clicking. Using heat mapping also alows use to see patterns which may influence future projects. 

This data is then analysed by the team. What worked, what didn't work and how can we make it better and if changing it will add value to the journey. It could be as simple as moving a button or redesigning a certain part of the user journey. Once these changes have been made we will repeat the steps above but with a new group of users who are fresh to the interface so we can compare and evalute the journeys.

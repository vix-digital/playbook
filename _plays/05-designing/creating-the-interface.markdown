<h4> Initial idea sketches </h4>

When creating any new interface we like to sketch. It helps us to get all ideas, good and bad, out in the open by having them down on paper it often allows people to let go of ideas and move on, either to develop further or go in another direction. By getting our ideas on paper we are able to identify problems and concerns before we are in too deep. Our sketches are never considered pieces of artwork or do we expect them to be, aslong as they are concise and able to commnicate the idea to the rest of the team.

Our paper prototyping starts with the mobile interface first. It is always easier to scale up than scale down and the constraints of mobile screens enable you to think about what is really necessary to user rather than the fill the space. Using the mobile user journey we can map out each stage, breaking down every button, interaction point and interface.

We love tools such as Invision to create our digital prototypes, working alongside sketch the two are the perfect match for rapid prototyping and enabling access for user testing.

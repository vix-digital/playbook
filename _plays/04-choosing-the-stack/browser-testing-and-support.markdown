At VIX we like to use the latest and greatest technology and techniques to make our applications look amazing and feel great to use. That's why in our newer projects we only support more modern browsers. The browsers we support are as follows:

- Google Chrome (Latest)
- Mozilla Firefox (Latest)
- Apple Safari (Latest)
- Microsoft Edge (Latest)
- Internet Explorer 11.0+

We do not support Opera, however depending on the project we may decide it is necessary to support older version of Internet Explorer. This can increase the cost of a project as it often takes more development time to realise complex application functionality and designs in older browsers.

As far as mobile devices are concerned we support the latest versions of Chrome and Safari.

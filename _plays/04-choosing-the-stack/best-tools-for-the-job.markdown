Choosing the best technology for the job is an area we invest a significant portion of our time on at VIX. Giving us the flexibility to approach a wide range of technology and solutions with confidence. 

<h4> How we choose our tools </h4>

As a team we constantly identify new, updated and existing technology with the potential to make it in to an application stack. Determining whether a technology is at a stage where we should assess, trial or adopt it. This decision is made by evaluating how well a technology meets the need for a project, from stability to security, in addition to the ability for teams to support our projects when working as an extension of an existing team. We do this to stay on top of the latest and greatest, but also so that we can share that expertise and allow our teams and clients to focus on users needs and delivery.

<h4> Be boring, sometimes </h4>

It is ok to choose the boring solution when it is the best solution. This is a concept we share across multiple disciplines here at VIX. Boring is often stable, well documentated and is inherently secure. Some of the great clients we work with have teams we integrate with and share our findings with. Sometimes it makes sense to use the technology they are comfortable with so they can do what they do best and deliver great user experiences.

<h4> Delivery focused </h4>

Delivering excellent solutions to market quickly is important to us. We achieve this by utilizing cutting edge technology and open source projects that are ready for adoption. Putting the right tools in the hands of great people to improve engineering velocity.

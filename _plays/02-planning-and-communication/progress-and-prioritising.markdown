Our primary goal for progress and prioritisation is to deliver the most possible value we can during a time frame. With fixed outcomes, this means prioritising higher risk and investment issues up front to ensure any issues that block progress are identified early on in a project. With more agile approaches, we focus on identifying the highest value we can deliver during a sprint.

<h4> Progress </h4>

We track progress on issues using a variety of tools and ceremonies. From daily standup, to kanban boards in Trello, and finally as Issues tracked in our source control. At VIX we are data driven, and all our progress metrics are stored and create automatic burn down charts and other progress tracking metrics to help us gauge our engineering velocity as well as provide clients with an overview of the current progress.

<h4> Prioritization </h4>

When delivering agile projects, we use techniques such as the Kano model to plot units of delivery against metrics such as user satisfaction and the amount of investment required to achieve it. We do this so that we can focus on targeting the user need and deliver value as quickly as possible. Prioritization is quite a complex area to tackle well, and forms a substancial part of our sprint planning process.

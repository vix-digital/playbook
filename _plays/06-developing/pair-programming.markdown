Pair programming might seem like a *strange* concept to some people - having two programmers work on one machine might seem less efficient, but there are numerous benefits of doing a bit of paired work from time to time.

Code produced during a pair programming session is almost always higher quality than code produced by a lone programmer. Higher quality pair programmed code can produce savings by way of a reduction in technical debt and bugs.

Having two sets of eyes checking over every line of code as it's written acts as a sort of realtime peer review that ensures the best knowledge of both participants going into the work at hand. 

Sometimes we pair with colleagues of a different skillset to our own - which allows us to share our individual experience and coach each other while still producing work towards a deadline.

**Collaboration is king** - especially when you can reduce the number of barriers between you.

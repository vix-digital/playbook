We always use source code control across our projects. Due to our collaborative nature, we can't imagine going back to not having tools like [Git](https://git-scm.com/) available. 
Git allows us to work in parallel, backup code, handle merging of source code and much more.

We use GitHub pages for repositories of information such as this, and GitLab for the majority of our applications and CI pipelines. We have also used BitBucket with the Jira workflow, but the culture isn't quite right for us for the majority of the projects we undertake.

If we could only give one piece of advice to coders, it would be to learn Git.

Code refactoring is the process of restructuring code without altering the behaviour AKA changing its factoring or composition.

There's a lot of reasons for refactoring code, which can range from taking over development of someone elses codebase to simply having learnt new techniques or improved your skills to the point that you can just do it better than before.

We can't cover code refactoring here in the detail it deserves, but we have written an [in depth blog post](http://vix.digital/insights/what-code-refactoring/) on it that covers some of the core concepts and solutions.

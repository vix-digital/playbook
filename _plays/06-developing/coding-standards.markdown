title:  "Coding Standards"
categories: developing
---

Due to the large variety of technology and coding languages we cover, we refer to coding standards to help reinforce good practice and consistency during development. Any language specific questions can usually be resolved by referring to these documents.

Due to the vast area to cover during this guide, we have separated it in to a separate document which we can contribute to and maintain separately. This document is currently a work in progress but can be found [here](https://vix-digital.github.io/code-guide/).

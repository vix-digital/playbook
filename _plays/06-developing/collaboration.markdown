The ability to collaborate, and collaborate well, is one of the most highly sought after traits we develop here at VIX. With many of our projects including remote workers, remote teams and offline working, it's imperative that we make collaborating as easy as possible.

<h4> Meaningful code </h4>

Although we use comments for some sections of our code bases, good code should be understandable without. This means meaningful verbose names and logical ordering. Some of these techniques are established as standards which can be found in the coding-standards section. However, the majority of these decisions come down to a shared agreeable and consistent approach.

<h4> Documentation </h4>

Our first step to encouraging collaboration is through great documentation. All of our projects, guides and wikis need to have contribution guidelines that anyone can follow regardless of technical prowess. Documentation is one of the best value returns we can receive for time invested in a project and is a no brainer.

<h4> Encouragement and Sharing </h4>

We try to be as open as possible when developing systems, where appropriate. The aim is to deliver fast and deliver often, backed up with peer reviews and automated testing. By being as transparent as possible we can get quick feedback and not be held back by the notion of getting things absolutely perfect in a development setting before having a second pair of eyes overlook the implementation.

<h4> Communication </h4>

A recurring theme throughout most of our playbook is good communication strategies. Development is no different, and it is important that everyone is able to track discussions that have happened around individual developments regardless of their location. If it hasn't been written and tracked in an issue, it doesn't exist. We tend to provide key information alongside the tasks that need to be completed with the aim that anyone should be able to contribute to solving the issue without having attended a physical standup, discussion or private message.

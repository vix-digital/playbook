We're a huge fan of testing. Testing encompasses a wide area of development activity here at VIX, with our pipelines carrying out a wide range of automated tests on a frequent basis.

When done well, testing allows us to deliver great software faster than we could ever achieve with manual testing alone and at a more consistent rate. Being able to reliantly deploy the same build we have worked on in a development environment to live or staging environments with utmost confidence.

Test Driven Development is not a new concept, and we simply build on these practices by encorporating testing in to any area that will improve our delivery velocity and reliability of builds.

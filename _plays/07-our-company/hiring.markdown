<h4> The Process </h4> 

We tailor our hiring process to suit the individual role and person. When finding new members for the team there are a few things we look for.
- **Cultural Fit** - It is important that the individual fits in with the rest of the team and shares our values. 
- **Work Ethic** - We know when it's time to play and when it's time to work.
- **Drive** - We are always improving and working on their development whether it's at work or in their own time. 
- **Fun** - Most importantly we enjoy what we do and have fun doing it. 

This is an outline of what at candidate will experience.   

<h4> Skype Interviews </h4>

When we receive applications, members of the team will review each candidate and invite the successful applicants to a skype interview. We like to use skype interviews as a first point of call as it allows us to get the know the candidates before we invite them into the office. Skype interviews also allow us to plan for the next step. We can decide where the persons strengths lie and how we can utilise them or help them grow in areas they are weaker. It also lets the candidate get to know us. 

<h4> Meeting The Team </h4>

The candidates are then invited to come into the office where they will spend the day with the team, starting with an informal discussion, food, a few rounds of pool and a run through of the agenda for the day. This gives us a chance to see how the candidates will fit culturally within the team and help them feel relaxed. 

A short timed task is set for the afternoon, based around creating an outcome that will test each candidate's role from design to backend development. It is left to them to manage their time and workload. 

Once the time is up we invite the candidates to give a show and tell, outlining what they did, why they did it and what they would do to take it further. 

<h4> Feedback </h4>

We like to review as a team as soon as we can to allow us to feedback to the candidates. This will sometimes include a development plan designed to help them can get to where they need to be or they will be invited to join the team. 

Whatever the outcome in the hiring process we like candidates to feel like they have valued from the experience and leave feeling they have learnt something new.
